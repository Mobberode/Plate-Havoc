### Notice
Plate Havoc will completly override the vanilla gameplay. Do not play in worlds that you dont want being changed.

# Plate Havoc
The game thats based on the Plate genre of Roblox. Cooperate with a team of players or go solo by yourself to survive endless amounts of random events which gets more harder as the intensity rises up with each event until everyone dies.

## Fundamental Gameplay
Survive events that will randomly happen. The bossbar at the top shows how long until an event. Intensity will rise when events happen, controlling the severity of the events.

# Roguelike Test
## Cyclathrons
Cyclathrons is money thats shared amongst everyone. Cyclathrons is mainly used to buy Upgrade Cards. How to get Cyclathrons is to collect Clocks that will periodcally spawn around the plate, collecting them will both reduce the time needed until the next Cycle and give Cyclathrons.

## Time and Cards
Time which naturally ticks down and can be brought further down via Clocks, is the only way to advance to the next Cycle. Completion of the Cycle, players are prompted to vote on a Card that will be in the run. Cards can be Upgrades/Curses. Upgrades will make the game easier, costing Cyclathrons and being able to be skipped. Curses however are forced and will make the game slightly harder and may reward an specified amount of Cyclathrons upon selection.
