### Notice
Plate Havoc will completely override the vanilla gameplay. Do not play in worlds that you don't want to be changed.

# Plate Havoc
The game that's based on the Plate genre of Roblox. Cooperate with a team of players or go solo by yourself to survive endless amounts of random events which gets more harder as the intensity rises up with each event until everyone dies.

## Fundamental Gameplay
Survive random events. The bossbar up top displays when events happen. Intensity will rise upon an event, controlling the severity of the events.

# Roguelike Test
Dying is to be expected. Trial and error are key to success.

## Cyclathrons
Cyclathrons is a team-shared currency, earned by collecting clocks or other means.\
Cyclathrons are mainly used to buy Upgrade Cards.

## Time
Time can be reduced by Clocks and are the only objective for progressing to the next Cycle.\
Completion of the Cycle will prompt players to select Cards that will affect the run.

## Cards
Cards provide either a benefit, disadvantage or a mixture of both.\
Upgrades will make the game easier, costing Cyclathrons and are able to be skipped.\
Curses are forced and will make the game harder alongside rewarding a specified amount of Cyclathrons based on severity.
